Hey, you wanna

Study neuroscience

Join the Alliance

Hey, you wanna

Study brains

Get up on

That train

Hey, you want

A scientific spin

On consciousness

Can't stand

No nonsense

Wanna understand

The mechanisms

Of mental illness

Hey, you wanna

See those ion channels

Open

As doors open

Want to simulate

Some Hodgkin-Huxley

Read that fMRI paper

By Haxby

No problem, amigo

Read this credo

Have you got

What it takes

Will you refrain

From slamming

The brakes

Will you go

All the way

Implement

The optogenetic ray

Do you crave

The knowledge

Well then

Eat your porridge

Run your mile

Thinking of spike generation

All the while

Don't stop

Let it drop

The world

Will be amazed

The society

Will be phased

As knowledge is common

Science blossoms

Do you have

What it takes

Raise the stakes

Do a PhD

Do a PostDoc

Decrypt the

Brain's mysteries lock
